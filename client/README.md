# Client - React Frontend

This is the frontend application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It is a part of the Express-React-TS-Template full-stack setup.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the client in development mode using Vite.
- `npm run build`: Builds the client for production.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the client code using ESLint.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build.
- `npm test`: Runs tests with Vitest.

## Development

Ensure that you have installed dependencies by running `npm install` in the root folder. To start the client only, you can run:

```bash
npm run dev -w client
```

The application will run on `http://localhost:5173`.

# Server - Express Backend

This is the backend server built with **Express** and **TypeScript**. It handles the API and any server-side functionality for the full-stack application.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the server in development mode using `ts-node`.
- `npm run start`: Runs the compiled server code.
- `npm test`: Runs server tests with Jest.

## Development

Ensure that you have installed dependencies by running `npm install` in the root folder. To start the server only, you can run:

```bash
npm run dev -w server
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.
